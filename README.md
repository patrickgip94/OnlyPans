***OnlyPans is a OnlyFan clone***. OnlyPans is a cutting-edge app designed specifically for chefs who want to sell their recipes and tutorial videos to a broader audience. This app serves as an innovative platform that connects chefs with food enthusiasts who are eager to learn new cooking techniques, discover unique flavors, and experiment with new ingredients.

Through OnlyPans, chefs can offer their followers exclusive access to their recipe collections and tutorial videos by setting up a subscription-based service. This means that fans can sign up to receive regular updates and access to new recipes and tutorials, while chefs can earn a steady income from their creations.
